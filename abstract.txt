Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause for dementia (loss of memory and other cognitive abilities). Alzheimer’s disease is caused when some part of  the brain cells is not working well. This is mainly by plaques and tangles. Plaques are deposits of a protein called “beta-amyloid” in spaces between nerve cells and tangles are twisted fibers of protein called “tau” that build inside neurons. These deposits can be seen in MRI scans but in the early stages it is very difficult to see them with naked eye. We propose a comparative study between attention models like Vision Transformer and Compact Convolutional transformer and state-of-the-art models like VGGNet, ResNet, and AlexNet to classify MRI images into 4 categories. Compact Convolutional Transformer gives better testing accuracy than vision transformers which show that convolutions work better than image patching. Out of all the models, VGGNet gives the highest accuracy of 74.59\%. Attention models require a lot of data. We had limitations of data for this project and hence, attention models are not performing to their optimum.
